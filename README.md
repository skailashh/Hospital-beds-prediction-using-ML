This project is a Machine learning based project for regresssion tasks
The dataset taken is from a hospital in spain and the prediction is made on the no of hospital beds required for the next 7 days based on several features and the precedding 7 day bed requirement.
6 models are used namely,  Linear Regression, Regression Trees, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression , and two different architectures of artificial neural networks: Extreme Learning Machine and
Fully Connected Deep Neural Network.
The techniques used other than the usual model building are Continuous Training method and Clustering 
The performance metric used in the project is Mean Absolute Error
To further enhance the accuracy for the models and provide better interpretability to the users we have used explainable AI technique SHAP and LIME
